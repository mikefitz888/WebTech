    <h2>HTML</h2>
    We made use of the dot.js templating engine for html templating and used html 5 features. Such as input types for form elements
    to allow browser validation.

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    The site makes extensive use of CSS including CSS3. This is used mainly to aid the appearance of the site but also positioning of
    elements in rare cases (such as the normally hidden user dropdown menu).

    <h2>JS</h2>
    JavaScript plays a huge role in the functioning of this website. It is fundamental to both the server-side and client-side operation.
    It is used for communicating with the server in several cases, using websockets as well as AJAX. And also for animating the canvas
    elements. JQuery is used throughout to make interacting with elements easier, such as toggling visible tabs or adding dynamically 
    generated content recieved from websocket.

    <h2>PNG</h2>
    The Logo was created in GIMP by performing the following steps;
    <ul>
      <li>Make transparent background image</li>
      <li>Write the text with text tool onto top layer</li>
      <li>Create an ellipse with circle select on new layer under text</li>
      <li>Fill the ellipse with blue</li>
      <li>
        In a layer between blue and text make a black to transparent gradiant
        (could have used blue gradient to blue, but this experiments with layer
         opacity)
      </li>
      <li>Set layer opacity of black gradient to 30%</li>
      <li>Run antialias tool to smooth edges, resize canvas to desired dimenions</li>
    </ul>
    The following pictures capture this process.<br/>

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <h2>Server</h2>
    In order to support WebRTC, the site needed to use SSL, otherwise the browser would 
    deny any requests. We generated a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL and use
    that to fulfil this requirement. We run the server on port 443, as is the default
    port for SSL used by the browser, meaning that accessing https://localhost, takes
    the user to the correct port. We make use of websockets, on the same port, and a 
    "sub-server" that effectively deals with the websocket events. This acts as a
    signalling server which co-ordinates peer-to-peer communication between two users.
    <br/>

    In order to protect our users passwords, we used the stanford crypto library
    to hash all the users passwords serverside, using a randomly and securely
    generated salt which is at least the length of the hash function's output
    for the most secure salting. In addition, the source code has a hardcoded
    second salt called a pepper, which is an additional defense should the database
    be stolen but not the sourcecode.

    <h2>Database</h2>
    Our database is interacted with via a separate <em>DBWrapper.js</em> module,
    which controls all interaction with the database. The database itself is
    designed to use relational linking between many tables that each handle a
    specific part of a user's data, instead of just keeping all data in the same
    table.<br/><br/>

    For security, the database does not store any plaintext passwords, it stores
    both the salt and the hash of the "seasoned" password (the password has both
    a salt and a pepper added to it). This ensures that a leaked database does not
    easily compromise the security of our users (covered more in <em>Server</em>).
    Additionally, our infrastructure is secure against SQL injection.

    <h2>Dynamic Pages</h2>
    Dynamic content is added to pages in a couple of ways. A templating framework
    DoT.js is coupled with our own data sharing framework to control what is displayed.
    This is mainly used to show usernames or highlight active tabs.

    <h2>Depth</h2>
    For our depth in the website, we have used WebRTC to send a user's desktop
    screen capture across to a helper user, they are then able to see the user's
    screen and advise them. We created a robust event based framework, to manage
    interactions between the client and the framework. JS Promises manage a lot
    of the interaction to ensure correct ordering of events while allowing 
    concurrent processing.
