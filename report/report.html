    <h2>HTML</h2>
    We made use of the dot.js framework for html templating and used html 5 features.

    <h2>PNG</h2>
    The Logo was created in GIMP by performing the following steps;
    <ul>
      <li>Make transparent background image</li>
      <li>Write the text with text tool onto top layer</li>
      <li>Create an ellipse with circle select on new layer under text</li>
      <li>Fill the ellipse with blue</li>
      <li>
        In a layer between blue and text make a black to transparent gradiant
        (could have used blue gradient to blue, but this experiments with layer
         opacity)
      </li>
      <li>Set layer opacity of black gradient to 30%</li>
      <li>Run antialias tool to smooth edges, resize canvas to desired dimenions</li>
    </ul>
    The following pictures capture this process.<br/>

    <h2>Server</h2>
    <b>MIKE - Talk about https, sockets, certificates</b><br/>

    In order to protect our users passwords, we used the stanford crypto library
    to hash all the users passwords serverside, using a randomly and securely
    generated salt which is at least the length of the hash function's output
    for the most secure salting. In addition, the source code has a hardcoded
    second salt called a pepper, which is an additional defense should the database
    be stolen but not the sourcecode.

    <h2>Database</h2>
    Our database is interacted with via a separate <em>DBWrapper.js</em> module,
    which controls all interaction with the database. The database itself is
    designed to use relational linking between many tables that each handle a
    specific part of a user's data, instead of just keeping all data in the same
    table.<br/><br/>

    For security, the database does not store any plaintext passwords, it stores
    both the salt and the hash of the "seasoned" password (the password has both
    a salt and a pepper added to it). This ensures that a leaked database does not
    easily compromise the security of our users (covered more in <em>Server</em>).
    Additionally, our infrastructure is secure against SQL injection.

    <h2>Dynamic Pages</h2>
    <b>MIKE</b>

    <h2>Depth</h2>
    For our depth in the website, we have used WebRTC to send a user's desktop
    screen capture across to a helper user, they are then able to see the user's
    screen and advise them. <b>MIKE</b>
